\chapter{Introduction}

Every dissertation should have an introduction.  You might not realize
it, but the introduction should introduce the concepts, background,
and goals of the dissertation.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
  \hline 
Title & Author \\
\hline
War And Peace & Leo Tolstoy \\
The Great Gatsby & F. Scott Fitzgerald \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{A normalsize table.  There has been a complaint that table
captions are not single-spaced.  This is odd because the code
indicates that they should be.}
